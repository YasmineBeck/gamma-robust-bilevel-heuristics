# Counterexample
As discussed in [the paper](https://optimization-online.org/?p=26186), the main result by [Bertsimas and Sim (2003)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-003-0396-4) cannot be carried over to the bilevel setting. For the case of general $\Gamma$-robust mixed-integer linear bilevel problems, it may even be the case that none of the solutions to the deterministic bilevel sub-problems solved in Line 3 of Algorithm 3 in the paper is feasible for the $\Gamma$-robust bilevel problem. We observe this behavior for the nominal instance of size `n = 40` given in [counterexample.txt](./counterexample.txt) with the uncertainty parameterization given by `uncertainty = 0.1` and `conservatism = 0.5`. The latter implies that $\Gamma = 20$ and that all lower-level objective function coefficients are equally perturbed by 10% of the nominal value. In [this directory](./), we provide the numerical results for all deterministic bilevel sub-problems that need to be solved when applying the heuristic for $\Gamma$-robust bilevel problems to this instance. For example, `counterexample_20.json` contains the numerical results for the bilevel sub-problem with sub-problem index `20`. To verify that indeed none of the solutions to the deterministic bilevel sub-problems solved within the heuristic framework is $\Gamma$-robust feasible, simply run

```
python3 -m counterexample.check_counterexample
```

from [the main directory](../).
Here, for each fixed leader's decision obtained from solving a bilevel sub-problem of the nominal type, all lower-level sub-problems are solved (cf. Lemma 1 in the paper) to determine whether the pair $(x,y)$ that is output as a solution of the bilevel sub-problem is $\Gamma$-robust feasible. Running the above script returns the message that there is no bilevel sub-problem for which the solution is $\Gamma$-robust feasible.
